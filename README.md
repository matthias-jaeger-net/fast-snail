Attempt of a viusal editor that runs locally and can deploy a static webpage.

# Inspirations
* WordPresss Gutenberg Editor – Good but not design flexible
* Elementor Page Builder – Excellent example, simle to use but not open source

# Basic features
* Start from an empty page
* Add basic design templates to a page via action button
* Edit content inside of templates on a page
* Save the page and create a static production build

# Advanced feature ideas
* Create UI and functionality similar to WordPress
* Use headless WordPress and the WordPress API in combination with React
* Group multiple templates and save as new template as in Elementor
* Automatic deploy process to a public staging server via ssh and git

# What's going on
- [x] Create repo
- [x] ``npx create-react-app``
- [x] Cleanup files
- [x] Start with "Action Button" idea and proof of concept
